This is the main repository for the code structure of the olympic robot of Group 3 in the University of Notre Dame's Senior Design course of Fall 2024.

The robot must perform four tasks: Weightlifting (carrying and dropping a dumbbell), Agility (navigating through cones), Shotput (collecting, sorting, and launching colored balls), and Sprinting (self explanatory).

Driving, weightlifting, and launching commands are performed using remote connection to a gamepad and a variety of motors hooked up to a Raspberry Pi microcomputer.

Ball sorting is done autonomously using color sensing and servo gates.
